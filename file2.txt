In this tutorial, I will explain how to use Git for your personal projects. We will assume you are creating a project from scratch and want to manage it with Git. After going through the basic commands, we will have a look at how you could put your code in the cloud using GitHub.
Also, we set the UI color to auto so that the output of Git commands in the terminal are color coded. The reason we prefix --global to the command is to avoid typing these config commands the next time we start a Git project on our system.
